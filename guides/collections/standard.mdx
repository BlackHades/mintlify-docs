# Payfonte Standard

The Payfonte checkout page is a page that allows customers to complete their purchases. Here is how it works:

- From your infrastructure/application, call
  our [Generate Checkout URL Endpoint](https://docs.payfonte.com/api/#post-/payments/v1/checkouts) with the payment
  details.
- We will provide you with a link to a payment page, which you can then redirect your customer to in order to complete
  the payment process.
- Once the transaction is complete, we will redirect the customer back to you.

## 1. Get all the payment details

## 2. Call the endpoint to generate a checkout URL

Next, in order to initiate the payment process, you will need to call
our [Generate Checkout URL Endpoint](https://docs.payfonte.com/api/#post-/payments/v1/checkouts) API and provide the
collected payment details. Please ensure that you authorize the API call using your client-id and client-secret. Below
is an example in Node.js:

```shell shell
curl --location 'https://sandbox-api.payfonte.com/payments/v1/checkouts' \
--header 'client-id: <client-id>' \
--header 'client-secret: <client-secret>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data-raw '{
    "reference": "0f0d9d90-9099-435e-9aa1-2c000ef8598b",
    "amount": 50000,
    "redirectURL": "https://payfonte.com",
    "customerBearsCharge": false,
    "webhook": "https://webhook.site/93745537-9d53-4aeb-b8ac-a489e0dd9967",
    "user": {
        "email": "dummy@dummy.com",
        "phoneNumber": "07012345678"
    }
}'
```

After making the API call, you will receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "644ebe614c2604002fac9d13",
    "url": "https://checkout-staging.payfonte.com/payfusion/644ebe614c2604002fac9d13",
    "shortURL": "https://l.6bd.co/m_DbfggPw",
    "reference": "0ba83bfd-9bba-48d4-b182-57cb4d1442cb",
    "amount": 50000
  }
}
```

## 3. Redirect the user to the generated payment link

Once you receive the response, simply redirect your customer to the link provided in `data.shortURL` or `data.url`. Our
checkout modal will be displayed to your customer, allowing them to complete the payment process.

## 4\. After the payment

This following event will occur after a payment is completed

1. The customer will be redirected to the URL specified in `redirectURL` with the `status` and `reference`.
2. If you have webhooks enabled, we will send you a notification via webhook once the payment is completed. To learn
   more about webhooks and see examples, please visit the following link [Webhooks](../collections/webhook.md).

[//]: # (## 5\. When Payment Fails)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (In the event that a payment attempt fails, such as due to insufficient funds, there is no need for you to take any)

[//]: # (action. The payment page will remain open so that the customer can try again with another provider until the payment is)

[//]: # (successful or they choose to cancel.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If you have webhooks enabled, we will send you a notification for each failed payment attempt. This can be useful if you)

[//]: # (need to follow up with customers who had issues with payment at a later time. Please refer to)

[//]: # (our  [Webhooks]&#40;../collections/webhook.md&#41; guide for an example of how this works.)
