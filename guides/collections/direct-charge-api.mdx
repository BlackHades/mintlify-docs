# Payfonte Direct Charge API

The Payfonte direct charge API allows you to call some providers API directly from your backend application without using a
checkout session. Here is how it works:

- `Optional` From your infrastructure/application, call our [Fetch Provider Payment Properties](https://docs.payfonte.com/api-reference/disbursements/fetch-provider-properties) to get the additional the for the API call.
- Make a call to our direct charge API with the payment details
- Once the transaction is complete, We will send a webhook response to your webhook URL.

## 1. Get Payment Provider Properties [Optional for Some providers]

if you are using a provider that expects some addition properties for a direct call, this API will return what you need
to make that decision.
Example is Orange Senegal, Pawapay. You can find a list of providers that you need to fetch properties for in
the [Supported Providers](/guides/introductions/supported-providers) Section.
Find a Sample CURL Below to fetch provider properties:

```shell
curl --location 'https://sandbox-api.payfonte.com/payments/v1/payments/direct-charge/{{provider-slug}}/properties' \
--header 'client-id: <client-id>' \
--header 'client-secret: <client-secret>'
```

Here is a sample response for pawapay

```json
{
  "data": {
    "networks": [
      {
        "name": "Airtel",
        "image": "https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1422229945317744642/1f6bLEh__400x400.jpg",
        "value": "airtel"
      },
      {
        "name": "MTN MoMo",
        "image": "https://seeklogo.com/images/M/mtn-logo-40644FC8B0-seeklogo.com.png",
        "value": "mtn-momo"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## 2. Get all the payment details

First, you need to assemble the payment details. Here are the details you'll need:

| Field           | Type                   | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Required |
|-----------------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|
| `provider`      | String [Provider Slug] | This is the Provider we are routing the request to. e.g `mtn-momo-ivory-coast`                                                                                           | false    |
| `amount`        | Number                 | This is the amount to charge the customer. This should be in the lowest currency denomination                                                                            | false    |
| `reference`     | String                 | A reference code you'll generate to identify this transaction. This must be unique for every transaction. If you don't pass one, we will generate one for you.           | False    |
| `redirectURL`   | String                 | The URL to which the customer should be redirected after the payment is completed.                                                                                       | False    |
| `webhook`       | String                 | This is a URL, if this is passed we will send the event webhook payload to this endpoint                                                                                 |          |
| `customerInput` | Object                 | This is an object of inputs to be passed to the provider. This varies per provider. You can find more in the [Examples](/guides/collections/direct-charge/examples) Section. | True     |
| `narration`     | String                 | This is the transaction description                                                                                                                                      | False    |

## 3. Call the endpoint to initialize the Direct Charge

Next, in order to initiate the payment process, you will need to call
our [Direct Charge API](https://docs.payfonte.com/api-reference/collections/direct-charge-api) API and provide the
collected payment details. Please ensure that you authorize the API call using your client-id and client-secret. Below
is an example in CURL:

```shell
curl --location 'https://sandbox-api.payfonte.com/payments/v1/payments/direct-charge' \
--header 'client-id: <client-id>' \
--header 'client-secret: <client-secret>' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "reference": "9617a32a-e936-48b4-99bd-f0fcd882561c",
    "amount": 10000,
    "provider": "mtn-momo-ivory-coast",
    "webhook": "https://webhook.site/9e5c6a7c-3345-4e7a-8e05-f6c4cc61f4a0",
    "narration": "Test payment from payfonte",
    "customerInput": {
        "phoneNumber": "8023456789"
    }
}'
```

After making the API call, you will receive a response similar to this:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "sessionId": "e0b04887-ee15-40ba-a3c0-5efc8b207292",
    "provider": "mtn-momo-ivory-coast",
    "reference": "D20240612202245CGOCK",
    "amount": 10000,
    "status": "pending",
    "statusDescription": "Awaiting Customer Input"
  },
  "statusCode": 201
}
```

## 4. After the payment

This following event will occur after a payment is completed
1. If you have webhooks enabled, we will send you a notification via webhook once the payment is completed. To learn
   more about webhooks and see examples, please visit the following link [Webhooks](/guides/collections/webhook).

[//]: # (## 5. When Payment Fails)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (In the event that a payment attempt fails, such as due to insufficient funds, there is no need for you to take any)

[//]: # (action. The payment page will remain open so that the customer can try again with another provider until the payment is)

[//]: # (successful or they choose to cancel.)

[//]: # ()
[//]: # (If you have webhooks enabled, we will send you a notification for each failed payment attempt. This can be useful if you)

[//]: # (need to follow up with customers who had issues with payment at a later time. Please refer to)

[//]: # (our  [Webhooks]&#40;/collections/webhook.md&#41; guide for an example of how this works.)
