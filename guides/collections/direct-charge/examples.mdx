# Direct Charge Example Payload

A Basic Mobile Money Direct Charge Payload will look like this:
```json
{
    "reference": "{{$guid}}",
    "amount": 10000,
    "provider": "<provider>",
    "webhook": "https://webhook.site/9e5c6a7c-3345-4e7a-8e05-f6c4cc61f4a0",
    "narration": "Test payment from payfonte",
    "customerInput": {
        "phoneNumber": "<phoneNumber>"
    }
}
```

<br/>

Some Providers needs some extra data and we will list examples here:
## Pawapay
The `network` options can be gotten from the `Fetch Provider Properties` Endpoint
```json

    "reference": "{{$guid}}",
    "amount": 10000,
    "provider": "pawapay-{{country}}",
    "webhook": "https://webhook.site/9e5c6a7c-3345-4e7a-8e05-f6c4cc61f4a0",
    "narration": "Test payment from payfonte",
    "customerInput": {
        "phoneNumber": "8023456789",
        "network": "<network>"
    }
}
```
