# Authorization Mode
Payfonte supports 2 types of authorization for disbursement/payout processes to ensure secure transactions. This documentation provides detailed information on the implementation and usage of these authorization methods.

## Authorization Methods

- PIN Authorization
- Authorization URL

### 1. Pin Authorization

In PIN authorization, the merchant sets a PIN and includes this PIN in every API request for disbursements. This method ensures that only authorized users can initiate transactions.

#### Step 1: Set Up PIN

Navigate to any page in the `Disbursements` section of the dashboard and you will get a prompt to set your pin

PS: you can only do this once. you will have to reach out to support if you want to change this pin.

#### Step 2: API Request with PIN

Every API request must have the PIN field.

```jsx JSON
{
  ....
  "pin":"XXXX",
  ....
}
```

<br />

<br />

<br />

### 2. Authorization URL

In the Authorization URL method, the merchant provides a URL endpoint that Payfonte will call on every disbursement request. The call includes a payload hash for verification. The disbursement will be processed if the endpoint returns a 200 HTTP response (This is strict).

Navigate to the page in the `Disbursements -> Settings` section of the dashboard and you will get a prompt to set your authorization URL

### Best Practice
We advise the following should be done when we call your endpoint

- Validate the payload comes from us by calculating the hash and verifying it. Examples can be found [in the webhook page](/collections/webhook.md)
- Validate the amount in the payload matches what you sent
- Validate the customer has enough funds in their wallet with you to carry out the transaction if this is a B2C
