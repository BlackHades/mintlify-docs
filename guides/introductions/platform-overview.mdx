### Ecosystem Overview

You can interact with Payfonte using the Dashboard, or using APIs and Webhooks.
Payfonte also collects payment information from your customers via the hosted payment page and the merchant portal.

### Dashboard

The Dashboard is the Payfonte application. It allows you to create and configure your payment and payout gateways, provide access to your team members and assign them roles, and so on.

All you have to do is create an account and you can start setting up your provider accounts and related settings. This would be the quickest way to kick start using Payfonte.

You could always decide to switch to Payfonte API for handling your payment needs. Learn more about the Dashboard here

### APIs and Client LibrariesÂ¶

Payfonte offers HTTP-based RESTful APIs, which enable seamless interaction between your application, system, product, or service and our system. For further information, you can refer to Payfonte's API documentation and comprehensive integration instructions for client libraries.

### Hosted Checkout

Our hosted payment page provides your customers with the ability to make online payments for your products or services. These payment pages are PCI compliant and come with multiple themes that can be customized to align with your business requirements, all without requiring any development effort.

There are various approaches available for integrating a payment page with your service provider, including URL Redirect to a third-party hosted payment page, inline iFrame, embedded content within a merchant's page such as Direct Post or JavaScript-built forms, or directly via an API.
